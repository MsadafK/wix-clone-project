Internship Assignment - Wix Clone Project

This project is part of my internship assignment, where I was tasked with building a responsive landing page for a fictional template service. The project demonstrates my ability to implement core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while focusing on creating an intuitive and responsive design.

Features
Responsive Layout: The page adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

Interactive Elements: Hover effects and interactive buttons for a dynamic user experience.

Email Subscription Form: Includes form validation to ensure that users cannot submit an empty or incorrectly formatted email address.

Custom SVG Graphics: Used throughout the project for visual elements, including icons and illustrations.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content and creating the page layout.

Tailwind CSS: For styling the page and implementing the responsive design.

JavaScript (React.js): For form validation and handling interactive elements.

React router v6: For routing purposes.
